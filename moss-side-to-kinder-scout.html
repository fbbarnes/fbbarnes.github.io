We set out to walk from Moss Side to Kinder Scout in a single day. The route took us through the urban landscape of Manchester and Stockport, along the River Goyt and over the Marple Aqueduct, across the Western border of the Peak District National Park, and up to the iconic peak of Kinder Scout. With me were my brother, Christian, and friend, Darioush. Together, we walked over a marathon and climbed 4000ft from sunrise to sunset.

The route took us through Bredbury and the outskirts of Stockport. Here we walked past the old Welkin cotton mill and the Archimedes screw hydropower station by Otter's Weir on the River Goyt.
