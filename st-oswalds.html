St Oswald's Way is a 100 mile walking route spanning much of the enchanting countryside and coastline of Northumbria. 
The eponymous saint was an influential figure in the region's medieval history, and the route passes many of the key locations in his life - starting at a site of battle and ending on Holy Island.
  
I set out on this walk with Adam Coxson (who also joined me on the Coast to Coast); unfortunately, he was the only one to complete the whole route...
